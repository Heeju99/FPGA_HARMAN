Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock u_clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin u_clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk_pixel_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
