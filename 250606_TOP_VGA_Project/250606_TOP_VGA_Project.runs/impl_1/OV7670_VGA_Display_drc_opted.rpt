REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 U_frame_buffer_top/U_Frame_Buffer1/mem_reg_0_0 has an input control pin U_frame_buffer_top/U_Frame_Buffer1/mem_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[0] (net: U_frame_buffer_top/U_Frame_Buffer1/ADDRARDADDR[0]) which is driven by a register (U_OV7670_MemController/addr_reg_reg[0]_rep) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
